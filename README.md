</p>

## Motivation

Setting up a new developer machine can be an **ad-hoc, manual, and time-consuming** process.  `dev-setup` aims to **simplify** the process with **easy-to-understand instructions** and **dotfiles/scripts** to **automate the setup** of the following:

* **OS X updates and Xcode Command Line Tools**
* **OS X defaults** geared towards developers
* **Developer tools**: Vim, bash, tab completion, curl, git, etc
* **Developer apps**: Atom, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, Chrome, etc
* **PHP dev tools**: composer, php-cs-fixer, etc.

### But...I Don't Need All These Tools!

**`dev-setup` is geared to be more of an organized *reference* of various developer tools.**

**You're *not* meant to install everything.**

If you're interested in automation, `dev-setup` provides a customizable [setup script](#single-setup-script).  There's really no one-size-fits-all solution for developers so you're encouraged to make tweaks to suit your needs.

[Credits](#credits): This repo builds on the awesome work from [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) and [Nicolas Hery](https://github.com/nicolashery).

### For Automation, What About Vagrant, Docker, or Boxen?

[Vagrant](#vagrant) and [Docker](#docker) are great tools and are set up by this repo. I've found that Vagrant works well to ensure dev matches up with test and production tiers. I've only started playing around with Docker for side projects and it looks very promising. However, for Mac users, Docker and Vagrant both rely on **virtual machines**, which have their own considerations/pros/cons.

[Boxen](https://boxen.github.com/) is a cool solution, although some might find it better geared towards "more mature companies or devops teams". I've seen some discussions of [difficulties as it is using Puppet under the hood](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/issues/742).

This repo takes a more **light-weight** approach to automation using a combination of **Homebrew, Homebrew Cask, and shell scripts** to do basic system setup.  It also provides **easy-to understand instructions** for installation, configuration, and usage for each developer app or tool.

## Section 1: Installation

### Single Setup Script

#### Running with Git

##### Clone the Repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup.git && cd dev-setup

##### Run the .dots Script with Command Line Arguments

**Since you probably don't want to install every section**, the `.dots` script supports command line arguments to run only specified sections.  Simply pass in the [scripts](#scripts) that you want to install.  Below are some examples.

**For more customization, you can [clone](#clone-the-repo) or [fork](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/fork) the repo and tweak the `.dots` script and its associated components to suit your needs.**

Run all:

    $ ./.dots all

Run `bootstrap.sh`, `osxprep.sh`, `brew.sh`, and `osx.sh`:

    $ ./.dots bootstrap osxprep brew osx

Run `bootstrap.sh`, `osxprep.sh`, `brew.sh`, and `osx.sh`, `pydata.sh`, `aws.sh`, and `datastores.sh`:

    $ ./.dots bootstrap osxprep brew osx pydata aws datastores

#### Running without Git

    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup/master/.dots && ./.dots [Add ARGS Here]

#### Scripts

* [.dots](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/.dots)
    * Runs specified scripts
* [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/bootstrap.sh)
    * Syncs dev-setup to your local home directory `~`
* [osxprep.sh](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/osxprep.sh)
    * Updates OS X and installs Xcode command line tools
* [brew.sh](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/brew.sh)
    * Installs common Homebrew formulae and apps
* [osx.sh](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/osx.sh)
    * Sets up OS X defaults geared towards developers
* [pydata.sh](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/pydata.sh)

    * Sets up Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, and Amazon Web Services
* [datastores.sh](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/datastores.sh)
    * Sets up common data stores
* [web.sh](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/web.sh)
    * Sets up JavaScript web development
* [android.sh](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/android.sh)
    * Sets up Android development

**Notes:**

* `.dots` will initially prompt you to enter your password.
* `.dots` might ask you to re-enter your password at certain stages of the installation.
* If OS X updates require a restart, simply run `.dots` again to resume where you left off.
* When installing the Xcode command line tools, a dialog box will confirm installation.
    * Once Xcode is installed, follow the instructions on the terminal to continue.
* `.dots` runs `brew.sh`, which takes awhile to complete as some formulae need to be installed from source.
* **When `.dots` completes, be sure to restart your computer for all updates to take effect.**

I encourage you to read through Section 1 so you have a better idea of what each installation script does.  The following discussions describe in greater detail what is executed when running the [.dots](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/.dots) script.

### bootstrap.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/commands.png">
  <br/>
</p>

The `bootstrap.sh` script will sync the dev-setup repo to your local home directory.  This will include customizations for Vim, bash, curl, git, tab completion, aliases, a number of utility functions, etc.  Section 2 of this repo describes some of the customizations.

#### Running with Git

First, fork or [clone the repo](#clone-the-repo).  The `bootstrap.sh` script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder `~`:

    $ source bootstrap.sh

To update later on, just run that command again.

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

    $ set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh

#### Running without Git

To sync dev-setup to your local home directory without Git, run the following:

    $ cd ~; curl -#L https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh,LICENSE}

To update later on, just run that command again.

#### Optional: Specify PATH

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files before any feature testing (such as detecting which version of `ls` is being used takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Optional: Add Custom Commands

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Donne Martin"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="donne.martin@gmail.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"

# Pip should only run if there is a virtualenv currently activated
export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true

# Install or upgrade a global package
# Usage: gpip install –upgrade pip setuptools virtualenv
gpip(){
   PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV="" pip "$@"
}
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions, and aliases from the dev-setup repository, although it’s probably better to [fork the dev-setup repository](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/fork).

### osxprep.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/xcode.jpg">
  <br/>
</p>

Run the `osxprep.sh` script:

    $ ./osxprep.sh

`osxprep.sh` will first install all updates.  If a restart is required, simply run the script again.  Once all updates are installed, `osxprep.sh` will then [Install Xcode Command Line Tools](#install-xcode-command-line-tools).

If you want to go the manual route, you can also install all updates by running "App Store", selecting the "Updates" icon, then updating both the OS and installed apps.

#### Install Xcode Command Line Tools

An important dependency before many tools such as Homebrew can work is the **Command Line Tools for Xcode**. These include compilers like gcc that will allow you to build from source.

If you are running **OS X 10.9 Mavericks or later**, then you can install the Xcode Command Line Tools directly from the command line with:

    $ xcode-select --install

**Note**: the `osxprep.sh` script executes this command.

Running the command above will display a dialog where you can either:
* Install Xcode and the command line tools
* Install the command line tools only
* Cancel the install

##### OS X 10.8 and Older

If you're running 10.8 or older, you'll need to go to [http://developer.apple.com/downloads](http://developer.apple.com/downloads), and sign in with your Apple ID (the same one you use for iTunes and app purchases). Unfortunately, you're greeted by a rather annoying questionnaire. All questions are required, so feel free to answer at random.

Once you reach the downloads page, search for "command line tools", and download the latest **Command Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for Xcode**. Open the **.dmg** file once it's done downloading, and double-click on the **.mpkg** installer to launch the installation. When it's done, you can unmount the disk in Finder.

### brew.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/homebrew2.png">
  <br/>
</p>

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), a package manager that simplifies installing and updating applications or libraries.

Some of the apps installed by the `brew.sh` script include: Chrome, Firefox, Sublime Text, Atom, Dropbox, Evernote, Skype, Slack, Alfred, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, etc.  **For a full listing of installed formulae and apps, refer to the commented [brew.sh source file](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/brew.sh) directly and tweak it to suit your needs.**

Run the `brew.sh` script:

    $ ./brew.sh

The `brew.sh` script takes awhile to complete, as some formulae need to be installed from source.

**For your terminal customization to take full effect, quit and re-start the terminal**

### osx.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/osx.png">
  <br/>
</p>

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set OS X defaults geared towards developers.  The `osx.sh` script also configures common third-party apps such Sublime Text and Chrome.

**Note**: **I strongly encourage you read through the commented [osx.sh source file](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/osx.sh) and tweak any settings based on your personal preferences.  The script defaults are intended for you to customize.**  For example, if you are not running an SSD you might want to change some of the settings listed in the SSD section.

Run the `osx.sh` script:

    $ ./osx.sh

**For your terminal customization to take full effect, quit and re-start the terminal.**


## Section 2: General Apps and Tools

### Atom

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/atom.png">
  <br/>
</p>

[Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) is a great open-source editor from GitHub that is rapidly gaining contributors and popularity.

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Atom.

If you prefer to install it separately, [download](https://atom.io/) it, open the **.dmg** file, drag-and-drop in the **Applications** folder.

#### Configuration

Atom has a great package manager that allows you to easily install both core and community packages.

### Terminal Customization

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/terminal.png">
  <br/>
</p>

Since we spend so much time in the terminal, we should try to make it a more pleasant and colorful place.

#### Configuration

The [bootstrap.sh script](#bootstrapsh-script) and [osx.sh script](#osxsh-script) contain terminal customizations.

### Vim

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/vim.png">
  <br/>
</p>

Although Sublime Text will be our main editor, it is a good idea to learn some very basic usage of [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). It is a very popular text editor inside the terminal, and is usually pre-installed on any Unix system.

For example, when you run a Git commit, it will open Vim to allow you to type the commit message.

I suggest you read a tutorial on Vim. Grasping the concept of the two "modes" of the editor, **Insert** (by pressing `i`) and **Normal** (by pressing `Esc` to exit Insert mode), will be the part that feels most unnatural. After that it's just remembering a few important keys.

#### Configuration

The [bootstrap.sh script](#bootstrapsh-script) contains Vim customizations.

### VirtualBox

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/virtualbox.png">
  <br/>
</p>

VirtualBox creates and manages virtual machines.  It's a solid free solution to its commercial rival VMware.

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs VirtualBox

If you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or run:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
    $ brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" virtualbox

### Vagrant

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/vagrant.jpeg">
  <br/>
</p>

Vagrant creates and configures development environments.  You can think of it as a higher-level wrapper around VirtualBox and configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and Salt.  Vagrant also supports Docker containers and server environments like Amazon EC2.

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Vagrant.

If you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or run:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
    $ brew cask install --appdir="/Applications" vagrant

### Docker

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/docker.png">
  <br/>
</p>

Docker automates the deployment of applications inside software containers.  I think the following [quote](http://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/cloud-computing/731454-docker-a-shipping-container-for-linux-code) explains docker nicely: "Docker is a tool that can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux server. This helps enable flexibility and portability on where the application can run, whether on premise, public cloud, private cloud, bare metal, etc".

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Docker.

If you prefer to install it separately, you can download it [here](https://www.docker.com/) or run:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install docker
    $ brew install boot2docker

#### Configuration

Initialize and start `boot2docker` (only need to do this once):

    $ boot2docker init

Start the VM:

    $ boot2docker up

Set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable and fill in IP and PORT based on the output from the `boot2coker up` command:

    $ export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://IP:PORT

### Git

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/git.png">
  <br/>
</p>

What's a developer without [Git](http://git-scm.com/)?

#### Installation

Git should have been installed when you ran through the [Install Xcode Command Line Tools](#install-xcode-command-line-tools) section.

#### Configuration

To check your version of Git, run the following command:

    $ git --version

And `$ which git` should output `/usr/local/bin/git`.

Let's set up some basic configuration. Download the [.gitconfig](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup/master/.gitconfig) file to your home directory:

    $ cd ~
    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup/master/.gitconfig

It will add some color to the `status`, `branch`, and `diff` Git commands, as well as a couple aliases. Feel free to take a look at the contents of the file, and add to it to your liking.

Next, we'll define your Git user (should be the same name and email you use for [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)):

    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
    $ git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

They will get added to your `.gitconfig` file.

To push code to your GitHub repositories, we're going to use the recommended HTTPS method (versus SSH). So you don't have to type your username and password everytime, let's enable Git password caching as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git):

    $ git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

**Note**: On a Mac, it is important to remember to add `.DS_Store` (a hidden OS X system file that's put in folders) to your `.gitignore` files. You can take a look at this repository's [.gitignore](https://github.com/helhum/dev-setup/blob/master/.gitignore) file for inspiration.  Also check out GitHub's [collection of .gitignore templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

### Homebrew

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helhum/dev-setup-resources/master/res/homebrew.png">
  <br/>
</p>

Package managers make it so much easier to install and update applications (for Operating Systems) or libraries (for programming languages). The most popular one for OS X is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

#### Installation

The [brew.sh script](#brewsh-script) installs Homebrew and a number of useful Homebrew formulae and apps.

If you prefer to install it separately, run the following command and follow the steps on the screen:

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

#### Usage

To install a package (or **Formula** in Homebrew vocabulary) simply type:

    $ brew install <formula>

To update Homebrew's directory of formulae, run:

    $ brew update

**Note**: I've seen that command fail sometimes because of a bug. If that ever happens, run the following (when you have Git installed):

    $ cd /usr/local
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git reset --hard origin/master

To see if any of your packages need to be updated:

    $ brew outdated

To update a package:

    $ brew upgrade <formula>

Homebrew keeps older versions of packages installed, in case you want to roll back. That rarely is necessary, so you can do some cleanup to get rid of those old versions:

    $ brew cleanup

To see what you have installed (with their version numbers):

    $ brew list --versions
